# New Relic NerdGraph Interactions
This repository contains Python code to interact with the New Relic NerdGraph API. This is a work-in-progress, and I hope to add new features and functionality over time to help New Relic users more easily interact with NerdGraph in more meaningful ways.

# Requirements
You must have a New Relic User API key, which you can store in a .env file for the project code to use.
